There are two simple ways to use this page.

#### 1. URL Parameter (Recommended)

Redirect your web server's errors to this file and pass the error code in the URL. The page will automatically display
the correct chapter.

**URL Format:**
`.../pooh_errors.html?error={CODE}`

**Examples:**

* `.../pooh_errors.html?error=404` ‚û°Ô∏è Loads Chapter 404.
* `.../pooh_errors.html?error=403` ‚û°Ô∏è Loads Chapter 403.

#### 2. Set a Default Chapter

If you can't use URL parameters, you can set a default chapter by editing one line in the HTML file.

1. Open the `.html` file in a text editor.
2. Scroll to the `<script>` tag at the bottom.
3. Find and change this line:

   ```javascript
   // --- USER EDITABLE: DEFAULT ERROR CODE ---
   const USER_DEFAULT_ERROR_CODE = 418; // Change 418 to your desired default
   ```
